        <p>Developed by Dr. Delvian Brown</p>

        <p>
            AutHelp is an application designed to support parents of children with autism by connecting them
            with trained community helpers. The platform allows parents to get assistance, guidance, information,
            and direct support through a user friendly system built for real world needs. It facilitates communication.
        </p>

        <p>
            AutHelp was created to empower families across Jamaica and the wider Caribbean, ensuring that support for children with autism is always accessible. As the number of diagnosed cases rises in Jamaica, the need for a safe, connected, and trustworthy platform becomes increasingly important.

            AutHelp is designed for both parents seeking guidance and assistance, and helpers—professionals, volunteers, or caregivers—who wish to offer support.
        </p>

        <p>
            Parents can request help for daily routines, therapies, or learning activities, while helpers can volunteer their time and skills to make a real difference.

            The platform was inspired by the personal experience of Dr. Delvian Brown, who has seen firsthand the challenges and triumphs of caring for a loved one with autism. With this experience, AutHelp prioritizes privacy, security, and a user-friendly experience, ensuring that every interaction is safe, confidential, and supportive.

            AutHelp is more than just a tool—it’s a community that connects families, encourages learning, and provides reliable support for children with autism, helping them thrive in all aspects of life.
